# COVID-19-severity-host-genetic-predictor-model-explanation
In this study we identified 16 candidate genetic variants that are likely determinants of COVID-19 severity outcomes in patients from a prior study we carried out using 
the 2000 cohort genetic and clinical datasets (https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1062190/v1). We first used the saved ensemble host COVID-19 severity predictor model 
we trained with the 2000 cohort dataset and carried out an external prediction on a follow-up 3000 cohort dataset. 
Secondly, we further utilized the explainer dashboard python library to carry out an explanation of our model predictions particularly considering the new cohort 
dataset information. Lastly, we implored the Phenome-wide Association technique by leveraging the Bioinformatics tool of OpenTarget web tool (an open-source web
browser Bioinformatics tool) to associate our identified genetic variants with disease traits which could lead to plausible clinical trajectories of the COVID-19 disease 
in patients.
